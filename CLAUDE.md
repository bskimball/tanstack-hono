# Claude Guidelines

Prefer `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for repo-wide rules; this file is a quick Claude-oriented entry point.

## Essentials

- Key commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`, `npm run check`, `npm test`
- Never edit `src/routeTree.gen.ts` directly (auto-generated)

## References

- Repo-wide agent rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Commands + workflows: `docs/ai/commands.md`
- Architecture: `docs/ai/architecture.md`
